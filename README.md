# Creature Forge
A simple modular rigging solution

## Status
Currently, the project is **on hold**. I'll continue working on this again soon, but in the mean time I've got some other projects I want to get into.

## How far is the project along?
Currently, CreatureForge is nearing phase 1 completion, which allows for easy joint and skeleton creation through both a simple PySide interface and developer friendly API. There's a bunch of missing doc strings and no "official" docs, but they're mostly there.

## What's next?
My first stretch goal is complete phase 1. This includes a few minor goals:<br>

+   Complete documentation and compile using sphinx
+   Build a simple product webpage
+   Provide some examples

## What about the future?
*Phase 2* will allow users to install rig parts on top of these guides and their hierarchy. Intelligent primary and secondary rig options will allow for pairing functionality to avoid conflicting control.

*Phase 3* is polish. Templating, complete UI overhaul and the addition of supporting plugin architecture.

## That's it?
For now. This project is a slow roasting one, I'll get back to it eventually.
