# Currently in progress


# Things to do
- [ ] Set some build conventions in place for order of operation
  - [ ] Where do I instantiate components in parts?
  - [ ] What happens if I try apply settings to components after creation?

# Big problems
- [ ] Move naming rename() logic to name model
- [ ] Need a new name for parts/components, they're not very user friendly
- [ ] Fix all giant inits to use a simple name model as first arg

# Done
 - [x] Moved controller
