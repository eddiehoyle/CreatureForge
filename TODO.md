# IMPORTANT
* Atm guide hierarchy are properties, returning string of parent or children. Revert this back to guide objects

## Guide model
* ~~Move aimConstraint to point at child aim transform, not guide~~
* ~~Create condition node graph for aimConstraint~~
* ~~Add up aim control shapes to be visible to user~~
* ~~Add dashed/solid hierarchical shapes~~
* Write re-init logic
* Stress test guides parent and child logic, make sure nodes are being tided up
* ~~Add custom aim targets~~
* Tidy code to be more organised
* Add support for aim with X, Y or Z
* ~~Refactor to build on from Maya joints to allow for hierarchy and pivot movement~~

## Core
* Write logging tool
