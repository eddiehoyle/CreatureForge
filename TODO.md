# IMPORTANT
* Just added 4 dashed/solid transforms for easier axis recognition in connectors. its unfinished!!

## Guide model
* Write more docstrings
* ~~Write reinit from string~~
* Consider a shader swap setup to allow for XYZ axis swaps?
* ~~Move aimConstraint to point at child aim transform, not guide~~
* ~~Create condition node graph for aimConstraint~~
* ~~Add up aim control shapes to be visible to user~~
* ~~Add dashed/solid hierarchical shapes~~
* ~~Add cleanup for connectors~~
* ~~Write re-init logic~~
* ~~Stress test guides parent and child logic, make sure nodes are being tidied up~~
* ~~Add custom aim targets~~
* Add support for aim with X, Y or Z
* ~~Refactor to build on from Maya joints to allow for hierarchy and pivot movement~~
* ~~Atm guide hierarchy are properties, returning string of parent or children. Revert this back to guide objects~~
* Write axis swap logic (to chang from pointing down X to Y, Z)

## Connector model
* ~~Write reinit for connector class~~

## Core
* Write logging tool
* Figure out how to build an API for users

## IO
* Write position save/load logic
* Write hierarhcy (aim) save/load/ logic
* Write template save/load logic

## Template
* Create a template from guides

## UI
* ~~Create simple widget for guides~~
* PLAN PLAN PLAN PLAN PLAN 
* Write plugin logic

## Web
* Create web page for skeleton forge app
